# Whiteboard Challenge 7

Create a function that checks a link list to see if it is circular.
If it is return true. If it isn't return false.

This function is called testCircle. Takes only one argument, that is a linked list.

This function uses Big O(n);

To run the package, the user should     ```npm install``` then  ```npm start```.

To run the tests the user should    ```$ cd ../__test__``` and the ```npm test```.

## Testing

The test suite tests for the following:  
That the function takes only one argument,  
That the argument is an object,  
The Test should also check for valid circular list.

# WhiteBoard Challenge 05
## Linked Lists
### Find the value of the middle Node in a linked list.

nodebuild.js builds an individual node.
listbuild.js will take a value and build a new node and prepend it.
middle.js will take a list and if it is a valid list, ie has more than a head only or more than one node, will return the value of the middle node.
index.js is the entry point, it will also execute the building of a lost from the array.

### Tests

the test suite checks that the input is valid, ie more than one node, and not only a head.
the test suite also checks valid input.

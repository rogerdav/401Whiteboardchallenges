# Whiteboard Challenge 10

This challenge has two parts.
1. Checkbraces, takes a string as its argument and checks that the string has an evenly matched  
set of {}, if each opening { does not have a closing } then function returns false. If it does match the   
function returns true.

2. Binary, this takes an sorted array of numbers and performs a binary search to find the number.  
The function will return an object with the index and the value that was searched for.
If the search number is not in the array it will return a message to that effect.

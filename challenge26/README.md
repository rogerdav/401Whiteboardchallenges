#.map() .filter() and .reduce()

Create a utils.js module which exports the following methods: map(), filter(), and reduce(). You will implement these methods from scratch, not utilizing the built-in array methods.

## Big O notation
map = O(n)
filter = O(n)
Reduce = O(n)



### Installing

```npm install```  
That will install the required dependencies.

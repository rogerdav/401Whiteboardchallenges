#Whiteboard Challenge 31

Find the intersection of two arrays. I have used a basic object. I have assigned a property on the object for all items in the longest array, with a value of undefined. Then maped over the shorter array and if the property already exists on the object i have assigned the value to the property. Once all the properties have been assigned, checked for only properties that have values and those are the intersection.
